Things that could use improvement: 

* More semantic annotations for accessibility
* More tests - especially Navigation testing
* More error handling for no internet / no images / no results json

* Refactor paddings and margins to use a more consistent system
* Pre-load 'lower' images in the search results so that don't appear to 'pop' in when you scroll down.

* Add some filtering options to the 'search results' / main screen
* Add sticky header to 'search results' / main screen
* Add more buttons and more in general to the product detail page.
* Click on main image and see a full screen version of it. 

* Add more to size select bottom sheet. Ran out of time. 
* Refactor bottomsheet into reusable bottomsheet composable.

* Padding of swipe / horizontal scroll indicator in product detail main image is wrong, incorrect on right side. 
* Size of white space in html description text is horrible. 

* Could use Scaffold and have a navigation bar.
